# Google Keep takeout

## Getting Started

Run the script inside your takeout folder.

```sh
python export.py
```

After that you can get a markdown file inside your takeout folder which named:

Google Keep Notes Archive.md

### You also can download the compiled exe version of this script from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/erbanku/google_keep_takeout/releases) to do that.
